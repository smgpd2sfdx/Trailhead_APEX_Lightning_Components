/**
* @Author: Steven M. Giangrasso
* @Description: 3rd module of Asynchronous APEX
* Create an Apex test class called 'LeadProcessorTest'.
* In the test class, insert 200 Lead records, execute the 'LeadProcessor' Batch class 
* and test that all Lead records were updated correctly.
* The unit tests must cover all lines of code included in the LeadProcessor class, 
* resulting in 100% code coverage.
* Run your test class at least once (via 'Run All' tests the Developer Console) 
* before attempting to verify this challenge.
